We need to convert the buffer to a File object for OpenAI.
The OpenAI SDK expects a File-like object with a name property.

Change line 165 from:
  image: imageBuffer,

To:
  image: new File([imageBuffer], 'image.png', { type: 'image/png' }),

This creates a proper File object that OpenAI can process.
